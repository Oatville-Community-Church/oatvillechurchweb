# Mobile Navigation Implementation Notes

Date: 2025-08-08

Summary: Implemented unified mobile-first navigation across all primary pages using accessible hamburger toggle.

Key Features:

- Sticky backdrop-blurred bar (`bg-gray-900/95` with backdrop filter support fallback) to preserve readability over content.
- Hamburger button with `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, dynamic label swapping and icon swap (menu/close) for clarity.
- Slide-down panel attaches after header markup; hidden on `md` and up (desktop still shows horizontal list).
- Focus management & simple focus trap while open (loops Tab within menu; closes on `Escape`, outside click, or link activation).
- Links carry `data-nav-link` for auto-close and keyboard focus behavior.
- Added `scroll-mt-24` to inâ€‘page section targets for proper offset beneath sticky bar.
- Minor animation utility: `.animate-slide-down` and `@keyframes slide-down`.

Accessibility:

- First focusable link receives focus on open; previous focus restored on close.
- `aria-current="page"` maintained on active link variants per page.
- Escape key / outside click close interactions supported.

Performance Impact:

- Negligible JS addition (~1 KB pre-minify) inside existing main bundle. No external deps.

Next Opportunities:

- Consider extracting nav into a partial & build-time include to reduce duplication.
- Reduce total image weight (bundle exceeds soft 300 KB budget mainly due to large JPGs); evaluate further compression or responsive `<source>` sets.
- Implement prefers-reduced-motion respect by disabling slide animation when user has reduced motion setting.

End.
