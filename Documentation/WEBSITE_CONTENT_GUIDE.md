- **Don't delete the curly braces** `{` `}`
- **Don't delete the square brackets** `[` `]`
- **Don't change field names** like `"hero"`, `"ministries"`, `"serviceTimes"`

### Example of Correct Format

```json
"services": {
  "sundayWorship": {
    "name": "Sunday Worship",
    "time": "10:30 AM",
    "description": "Come join us for worship"
  }
}
```

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ‚ùå Missing comma: `"name": "John" "role": "Pastor"`
- ‚úÖ Correct: `"name": "John", "role": "Pastor"`
- ‚ùå Missing quotes: `name: John Doe`
- ‚úÖ Correct: `"name": "John Doe"`
- ‚ùå Changing field names: `"newName": "John Doe"`

**CRITICAL REMINDER**: Always keep the exact same structure (field names like `"hero"`, `"ministries"`, `"serviceTimes"`) - only change the content inside the quotes! Make small changes at first until you're comfortable with the process!
