Subject: Your Church Website is Ready - Next Steps to Go Live

Dear Pastor,

I hope this email finds you well! I'm excited to share that your new church website for Oatville Community Church is complete and ready for you to take over. The site has been fully built with modern technology and includes automated features that will make managing it much easier for you.

## üåê Your Website is Ready

Your website has been built and is currently accessible at:
**<https://oatville-community-church.github.io/oatvillechurchweb>**

However, to make it live on your custom domain (oatville-community-church.org), you'll need to complete a few setup steps.

## üìã What You Need to Do

I've created a comprehensive step-by-step guide that will walk you through everything. Since the website code is stored in a public repository, you can access the complete guide directly here:

**üîó Complete Setup Guide:** <https://github.com/Oatville-Community-Church/oatvillechurchweb/blob/main/Documentation/PASTOR_HANDOVER_GUIDE.md>

This guide includes everything you need:

### Week 1: Basic Setup

1. **Create your GitHub account** (free) - this is where you'll edit the website
2. **Set up your custom domain** using your Cloudflare account
3. **Get added to the church organization** (I'll do this once you have your GitHub account)

### Week 2-3: Learn the Basics

4. **Practice editing church information** - service times, contact info, announcements
5. **Learn to manage photos** and images on the site

## ‚ú® What's Already Working Automatically

I've set up several automated features so you don't have to worry about them:

- **YouTube videos update automatically** every Sunday morning - your latest sermons will appear on the site without you doing anything
- **Website rebuilds automatically** whenever you make changes (takes 2-3 minutes)
- **Mobile-friendly design** that looks great on phones, tablets, and computers
- **Fast loading and search engine optimized**
- **Secure HTTPS encryption**

## üöÄ Key Benefits of Your New Site

- **No monthly hosting fees** - GitHub Pages is free
- **Professional appearance** - modern, clean design
- **Easy to update** - edit content through simple web interface or mobile app
- **Automatic backups** - every change is saved in version history
- **Future-proof** - built with modern, maintainable technology

## üìû Getting Help

The guide includes detailed instructions with screenshots for each step. However, I'm available to help if you run into any issues:

- **Email:** [your-email@example.com]
- **Phone:** [your-phone-number]
- **Best times to reach me:** [your-availability]

I recommend starting with creating your GitHub account (it's free and takes about 5 minutes), then letting me know your username so I can add you to the church organization.

## üéØ Timeline

- **This week:** Create GitHub account, start domain setup
- **Next week:** Practice making content updates
- **Week 3:** Site should be fully live on your custom domain

The entire process should take 2-3 weeks to complete at a comfortable pace, with most of the technical setup happening in the first week.

## üì± Mobile Management

One of the great features is that you can update the website from anywhere using the GitHub mobile app - perfect for updating announcements or adding event photos right from your phone!

## ‚ö° Next Steps

1. **Click the guide link above** and bookmark it for easy reference
2. **Follow Phase 1** in the guide to create your GitHub account
3. **Email me your GitHub username** once created so I can add you to the organization
4. **Follow the domain setup guide** to connect your Cloudflare domain

I'm confident you'll find the system user-friendly once you get started. The guides are written specifically for church pastors and include everything you need to know.

Thank you for trusting me with this project. I'm excited to see how the new website will help Oatville Community Church reach more people in your community!

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need assistance with any of the setup steps.

Blessings,

[Your Name]
