WEBSITE UPDATE ISSUES: What Happened & How to Avoid Problems

Dear Pastor Oglesby,

I've reviewed the recent changes you made to the church website and wanted to explain what went wrong and provide some simple guidelines to help prevent similar issues in the future.

WHAT HAPPENED

You've been making great updates to keep the church information current! However, there were a couple of technical issues that prevented the website from displaying correctly:

1. The Missing Comma Problem (October 22)

What you did: Updated the worship service time from 11:00 AM to 10:45 AM and removed the evening service.

What went wrong: When you deleted the evening service line, it left a "trailing comma" that confused the computer.

The problem looked like this:

    "schedule": [
      "Sunday Morning Worship - 10:45 AM",
      
    ],

Should have been:

    "schedule": [
      "Sunday Morning Worship - 10:45 AM"
    ],

2. The Case-Sensitivity Problem (HTML file)

What happened: The website has special "placeholders" like {{ministries.seo.title}} that get replaced with real content. One had a capital "M" instead of lowercase "m", so it didn't work.

SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO AVOID ISSUES

When Editing JSON Files (like ministries.json)

1. The Comma Rule:
   • If it's the LAST item in a list, NO comma
   • If there are MORE items after it, YES comma

2. When Deleting Lines:
   • If you delete the last line in a section, remove the comma from the line above it
   • Think of it like a list: "apples, oranges, bananas" (no comma after the last item)

3. Test Your Changes:
   • After saving, run "npm run build" in the terminal
   • If you see an error like "Could not load ministries.json", there's a syntax problem

When Editing HTML Files

1. Placeholders are Case-Sensitive:
   • {{ministries.seo.title}} ✓ (correct)
   • {{Ministries.seo.title}} ✗ (wrong - capital M)

2. Don't Edit Placeholders:
   • Leave text like {{ministries.seo.title}} exactly as is
   • Edit the actual content in the JSON files instead

Safe Editing Practices

1. Make Small Changes: Edit one thing at a time, then test

2. Check the Website: After changes, view the actual website to make sure it looks right

3. Ask for Help: If something doesn't look right, don't hesitate to reach out!

WHAT'S FIXED NOW

✓ All JSON syntax errors are corrected
✓ All placeholders are working properly
✓ The website displays correctly
✓ Your content updates (Susan Oglesby as Children's Ministry Lead, updated service times) are showing properly

BOTTOM LINE

Your content updates are excellent and keep the website accurate! The technical issues were just small syntax problems that are easily avoided with these simple rules. You're doing great work keeping the church information current!

Feel free to continue making updates, and don't hesitate to ask if you run into any issues.
