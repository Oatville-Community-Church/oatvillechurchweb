# Copilot Working Documents

This directory contains session-based working documents created during development work with GitHub Copilot and AI assistants.

## Directory Structure

- `session-YYYY-MM-DD/` - Working documents for each development session
- Each session folder contains planning notes, progress tracking, technical analysis, etc.
- These documents are for development process only - NOT for end-user consumption

## Usage

When working on the project, create a new session folder with today's date:

- Example: `copilot/session-2025-10-21/`
- Include: planning notes, architectural decisions, debugging notes, progress tracking
- Keep working documents here to avoid cluttering the main Documentation folder

## Final Documentation

Completed, polished documentation for the pastor goes in the main `Documentation/` folder:

- Setup guides
- Content management guides  
- Troubleshooting guides
- User-facing documentation

This separation keeps development artifacts separate from production documentation.
